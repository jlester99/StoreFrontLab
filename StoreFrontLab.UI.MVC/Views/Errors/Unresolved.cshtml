@*---This is our basic, custom error page. No specific info for user, but it's a better
    user experience (same "site-feel"/nav, etc) and less info for hackers to use against us
    than the standard, scary, detailed ASP.NET Exception page.*@
<div class="col-md-12 text-center">
    <p class="pickles">@ViewBag.Title</p>
    <h2 class="text-warning">An Error Has Occured</h2>
    <p>
        That was not supposed to happen! We will get right to work trying to fix the issue.<br />
        In the meantime, you can <a href="@Url.Action("Index","Home")">click here to return to the home page</a>, or try again.
        If behavior persists, please contact site administrator.
